        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: June 17, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This application ("the App") is a personal, server-side bot designed for the sole purpose of automating video uploads for its owner. This policy outlines how data is handled within this limited scope.</p>

        <h2>2. Data We Access</h2>
        <p>To perform its function, the App requires access to the following data, granted solely by its owner:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TikTok Account Access:</strong> The App uses an OAuth 2.0 token to gain permission to upload videos to the owner's TikTok account. It only requests the `video.upload` scope.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Drive Access:</strong> The App uses an OAuth 2.0 token to access and read video files from a specific, pre-authorized folder in the owner's Google Drive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
        <p>The accessed data is used exclusively for the App's single function:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The App runs on a schedule (via AWS Lambda).</li>
            <li>It authenticates with the Google Drive API to download a single video file.</li>
            <li>It then authenticates with the TikTok API to upload that video file.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Authentication tokens (for TikTok and Google Drive) are stored securely as encrypted environment variables in the AWS Lambda environment. Video files are processed in-memory and are not stored on any server after the upload process is complete.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>No data is ever collected from users or shared with any third party. The App does not have any users other than its owner/developer. The data flow is strictly between the owner's authorized services.</p>
